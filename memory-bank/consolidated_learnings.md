### FastAPI & Pytest - Testing & Debugging Patterns

- **Pattern: Correct `monkeypatch` Target for FastAPI Endpoint Dependencies**

  - **Context:** When testing FastAPI endpoints with `pytest` and `monkeypatch`, if a service/function is imported directly into the endpoint module, the patch must target the name as it's looked up _within that endpoint module_.
  - **Strategy:** Use `monkeypatch.setattr("your_app.api.endpoints_module.imported_function_name", mock_function)`. Patching only the original definition path (e.g., `"your_app.services.module.defined_function_name"`) may not work if the endpoint has already resolved its import by the time `TestClient` is initialized.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures the mock is applied correctly, preventing tests from unintentionally calling real service logic, which can lead to misleading failures or side effects (like actual file I/O or database calls).

- **Pattern: Robust JSON Serialization of Pandas/NumPy Data in FastAPI**

  - **Context:** FastAPI's default JSON serialization (via `json.dumps`) can raise `ValueError` for non-standard types like `np.nan`, `pd.NA`, `pd.NaT`, or NumPy-specific numeric types.
  - **Strategy:**
    1.  **Service Layer Preparation:** In the service function returning a Pandas DataFrame, convert problematic types to Python `None` (e.g., `df_filled = df.replace({np.nan: None, pd.NaT: None})`).
    2.  **Endpoint Layer Conversion & Encoding:**
        - Convert the prepared DataFrame to a list of Python dictionaries (e.g., `records = df_filled.to_dict(orient='records')`).
        - For maximum safety, iterate through these records and explicitly cast values to standard Python types (e.g., `np.int64` to `int`, `np.float64` to `float`, `pd.Timestamp` to `value.isoformat()`, and re-check for `pd.isna(value)` to ensure `None`).
        - Finally, pass this list of "clean" Python dictionaries to FastAPI's `jsonable_encoder` (i.e., `return jsonable_encoder(clean_records)`). This utility is designed to handle many common data types for JSON conversion.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures that data passed to the client is always JSON-compliant, preventing runtime serialization errors and providing a consistent API response.

- **Pattern: Handling `pd.qcut` Errors in Data Processing**

  - **Context:** `pd.qcut` (used for quintile-based scoring) can fail if the data distribution doesn't support the requested number of quantiles (e.g., too few unique values).
  - **Strategy:** Wrap `pd.qcut` calls in `try-except ValueError` blocks. In the `except` block, implement a fallback binning strategy, such as using `df['column'].nunique()` to determine the number of bins if it's less than the desired number, or assigning a default score.
  - **Rationale:** Makes data processing pipelines more resilient to variations in data, preventing crashes and ensuring scores can still be generated.
  - _(Source: TaskRef "Stabilize RFM backend testing and resolve test failures", 2025-06-11)_

- **Guideline: Data File Path Management for Testability**
  - **Context:** Hardcoding absolute file paths (e.g., `BASE_DIR = "C:/..."`) in application code makes testing and deployment difficult across different environments.
  - **Strategy:**
    - Prefer using environment variables or configuration files to define base data paths.
    - Alternatively, design services to accept file paths as parameters.
    - For unit/integration tests involving file I/O:
      - Mock out the file loading parts of the service if the focus is not on I/O itself.
      - Use `pytest` fixtures like `tmp_path` to create temporary data files for tests, and configure the service (e.g., by patching path constants or passing paths) to use these temporary files.
  - **Rationale:** Improves test isolation, portability, and makes the application more configurable for different deployment environments.

### Data Preparation and Quality Assurance

- **Early Data Analysis**: Conduct thorough data analysis at the project's outset to identify quality issues before development begins. This prevents skewed results in analytical models like RFM by addressing problems such as missing values, negative transactions, and invalid data entries early. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)
- **Data Header Documentation**: Maintain a reference file (e.g., `data_headers.json`) for all datasets to ensure consistency in column naming across backend and frontend development. This reduces errors in data referencing and supports seamless integration. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)
- **Data Preprocessing Checklist**: Establish a preprocessing checklist based on data quality reports (e.g., `data_quality_report.md`) to systematically handle issues like negative values, missing data, and invalid entries before RFM calculations. This ensures accuracy in customer segmentation. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)

### Development Environment Management

- **Conda for Data Science Packages**: When working with Conda environments, use `conda install` for core data science packages like `pandas` to avoid dependency conflicts, rather than mixing with `pip`. This ensures a stable environment for data processing tasks. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)

### RFM Analysis Optimizations

- **Pattern: Reference Date Impact on Recency Scoring**

  - **Context:** The choice of reference date for Recency calculation (earliest vs. latest transaction date) affects how scores are interpreted and assigned.
  - **Strategy:** When using the earliest date from the dataset as the reference for Recency, ensure that higher scores (e.g., 5) reflect more recent activity by adjusting the calculation to measure days since the earliest date to the customer's last purchase. Document this logic clearly in code comments and logs to avoid confusion.
  - **Rationale:** Maintains consistency in scoring logic where higher scores indicate better customer engagement, aligning with business expectations for identifying active customers.
  - _(Source: TaskRef "Refinement of RFM Metrics and Segmentation", 2025-11-06)_

- **Pattern: Transparency in Quintile Binning for Stakeholder Understanding**

  - **Context:** RFM scores based on quintile binning can be opaque to business stakeholders without visibility into the cut-off values.
  - **Strategy:** Use the `retbins=True` parameter in `pd.qcut` to capture bin edges and log these cut-off values (e.g., via `logger.info`) during data processing. Consider exposing these ranges in API responses or documentation for business users if requested.
  - **Rationale:** Enhances trust and understanding of RFM metrics by providing concrete data-driven boundaries for score assignments, facilitating business discussions and validations.
  - _(Source: TaskRef "Refinement of RFM Metrics and Segmentation", 2025-11-06)_

- **Pattern: Custom Customer Segmentation Based on RFM Scores**
  - **Context:** Standard RFM scores may not directly map to actionable business categories for customer management.
  - **Strategy:** Define specific customer segments (e.g., VIP Customers, At Risk) using conditional logic on RFM scores (e.g., `if r == 5 and f >= 4 and m >= 4: return 'VIP Customers'`). Implement this as a function applied to the DataFrame for scalability, and allow for customization based on user feedback or evolving business needs.
  - **Rationale:** Translates analytical RFM scores into meaningful business categories, enabling targeted sales and marketing strategies based on customer behavior.
