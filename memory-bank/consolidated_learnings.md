# Consolidated Learnings: Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Objective

This file contains curated, summarized, and actionable insights derived from raw reflections logged in `raw_reflection_log.md`. It serves as the primary, refined knowledge base for long-term use, focusing on generalizable principles and project-specific best practices to enhance efficiency and reliability in the development of the Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard.

## Structure

Learnings are organized by topic or category for easy retrieval and application. Each section includes concise, actionable patterns or strategies with rationale where applicable.

## Learnings

### Data Preparation and Quality Assurance

- **Early Data Analysis**: Conduct thorough data analysis at the project's outset to identify quality issues before development begins. This prevents skewed results in analytical models like RFM by addressing problems such as missing values, negative transactions, and invalid data entries early. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)
- **Data Header Documentation**: Maintain a reference file (e.g., `data_headers.json`) for all datasets to ensure consistency in column naming across backend and frontend development. This reduces errors in data referencing and supports seamless integration. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)
- **Data Preprocessing Checklist**: Establish a preprocessing checklist based on data quality reports (e.g., `data_quality_report.md`) to systematically handle issues like negative values, missing data, and invalid entries before RFM calculations. This ensures accuracy in customer segmentation. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)

### Development Environment Management

- **Conda for Data Science Packages**: When working with Conda environments, use `conda install` for core data science packages like `pandas` to avoid dependency conflicts, rather than mixing with `pip`. This ensures a stable environment for data processing tasks. (Source: TaskRef "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation", 2025-06-11)

## Guidelines for Updates

- **High-Value Focus**: Only include insights that significantly impact future performance, resolve critical errors, or provide major time-saving discoveries.
- **Conciseness**: Keep entries clear and to the point, ensuring they are actionable for future tasks.
- **Pruning**: Remove outdated or redundant information to maintain density of high-value content.
- **Source Tracking**: Reference the original task or date from `raw_reflection_log.md` when consolidating for traceability, if relevant.

This document is a living knowledge base, to be updated periodically as raw reflections are processed, ensuring continuous improvement in the Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard project.
