# Active Context: RFM Analysis Backend Completion

## Current Focus

The backend for the RFM Analysis Dashboard is fully complete, and recent efforts have resolved connectivity issues between the backend and frontend. With CORS configuration updated and a script created to run both servers simultaneously, the project is now focused on frontend development to display RFM data and customer segments effectively.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Dynamic Filter Options:** Updated the `/api/filters` endpoint in `rfm_backend/app/api/endpoints.py` to dynamically populate filter options based on unique values from the dataset for fields such as "customer_group", "customer_type", "customer_ranking", and "state". This ensures that filter options reflect actual data attributes, enhancing user-driven segmentation.
- **Resolved FutureWarnings:** Modified `rfm_service.py` to address Pandas `FutureWarning`s by using `.replace()` and `.astype(str)` for handling invalid postcodes, ensuring long-term maintainability.
- **Refined RFM Metrics:** Adjusted the Recency calculation in `rfm_service.py` to use the earliest transaction date as the reference point for a comprehensive view of customer engagement. Ensured that higher scores are assigned for more recent activity (5 for most recent). Added logging for quintile cut-off values for Frequency, Monetary, and Recency metrics to improve transparency in scoring.
- **CORS Configuration Update:** Updated the CORS middleware in `rfm_backend/app/main.py` to allow requests from any origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`), enabling network access and resolving connectivity issues between the frontend and backend.
- **Startup Script Creation:** Created `start_project.bat` in the project root directory, a batch file that simultaneously starts the FastAPI backend and React frontend servers in separate terminal windows for streamlined development workflow.

## Next Steps

- **Frontend Development:** Continue the design and implementation of the frontend dashboard to display RFM data and customer segments, ensuring seamless integration with the backend API.
- **Filter Functionality:** Develop backend logic to apply user-selected filters from the frontend to dynamically adjust the RFM data returned by the API.
- **Deployment Planning:** Outline a deployment strategy for both backend and frontend components, considering network access configurations.
- **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback on the RFM metrics, segmentation, dashboard usability, and connectivity to ensure alignment with business objectives.

## Key Learnings & Patterns

- **FastAPI Endpoint Updates:** Dynamically populating API responses based on dataset attributes requires careful handling of data retrieval and unique value extraction to ensure performance and relevance.
- **Pandas Compatibility:** Addressing `FutureWarning`s in Pandas involves using explicit type casting or updated methods like `.replace()` to maintain compatibility with future library versions.
- **RFM Calculation Logic:** Using the earliest transaction date for Recency calculation provides a more intuitive measure of customer engagement over time, with scoring adjusted to reflect business value (higher scores for more recent activity).
- **Transparency in Scoring:** Logging quintile cut-off values for RFM metrics aids in debugging and provides clarity on how scores are assigned, which is valuable for business interpretation.
- **CORS Configuration for Connectivity:** Configuring CORS to allow requests from any origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`) is a practical solution for enabling network access, though it should be revisited for security in production environments.
- **Development Workflow Optimization:** Creating a batch script to launch both backend and frontend servers simultaneously streamlines the development process, reducing setup time and potential errors in starting servers individually.
