# Active Context: RFM Analysis Backend Completion

## Current Focus

The backend for the RFM Analysis Dashboard is now fully complete. The focus has been on finalizing the remaining backend tasks, including dynamic filter implementation and resolving minor warnings in the code. With these tasks accomplished, the project is ready to transition to frontend development for displaying RFM data and customer segments.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Dynamic Filter Options:** Updated the `/api/filters` endpoint in `rfm_backend/app/api/endpoints.py` to dynamically populate filter options based on unique values from the dataset for fields such as "customer_group", "customer_type", "customer_ranking", and "state". This ensures that filter options reflect actual data attributes, enhancing user-driven segmentation.
- **Resolved FutureWarnings:** Modified `rfm_service.py` to address Pandas `FutureWarning`s by using `.replace()` and `.astype(str)` for handling invalid postcodes, ensuring long-term maintainability.
- **Refined RFM Metrics:** Adjusted the Recency calculation in `rfm_service.py` to use the earliest transaction date as the reference point for a comprehensive view of customer engagement. Ensured that higher scores are assigned for more recent activity (5 for most recent). Added logging for quintile cut-off values for Frequency, Monetary, and Recency metrics to improve transparency in scoring.

## Next Steps

- **Frontend Development:** Begin design and implementation of the frontend dashboard to display RFM data and customer segments, integrating with the updated backend API.
- **Filter Functionality:** Develop backend logic to apply user-selected filters from the frontend to dynamically adjust the RFM data returned by the API.
- **Deployment Planning:** Outline a deployment strategy for both backend and frontend components.
- **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback on the RFM metrics, segmentation, and overall dashboard functionality to ensure alignment with business objectives.

## Key Learnings & Patterns

- **FastAPI Endpoint Updates:** Dynamically populating API responses based on dataset attributes requires careful handling of data retrieval and unique value extraction to ensure performance and relevance.
- **Pandas Compatibility:** Addressing `FutureWarning`s in Pandas involves using explicit type casting or updated methods like `.replace()` to maintain compatibility with future library versions.
- **RFM Calculation Logic:** Using the earliest transaction date for Recency calculation provides a more intuitive measure of customer engagement over time, with scoring adjusted to reflect business value (higher scores for more recent activity).
- **Transparency in Scoring:** Logging quintile cut-off values for RFM metrics aids in debugging and provides clarity on how scores are assigned, which is valuable for business interpretation.
