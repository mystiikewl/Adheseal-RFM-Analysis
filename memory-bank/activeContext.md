# Active Context for Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus was to resolve a data connection issue in the RFM Analysis Dashboard and modify the available filters. This involved ensuring the backend server was running correctly and updating the filter set to Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment.

## Recent Changes

- **Data Connection Resolution**: Successfully re-established the data connection by ensuring the backend server was running and accessible.
- **Filter Modifications**:
  - Updated the backend API (`endpoints.py`) to provide filter options for Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment.
  - Modified the frontend state management (`rfmStore.js`) to handle the new filter set.
  - Updated the UI (`DashboardPage.jsx`) to display the new filters and adjust the filtering logic.
- **Tailwind Configuration Attempts (Previous)**:
  - Uninstalled `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
  - Installed `@tailwindcss/vite`.
  - Updated `vite.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/vite`.
  - Modified `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";`.
  - Adjusted `postcss.config.js` multiple times (commented out, set to minimal).
- **Theme Implementation (Previous)**: Support for light and dark themes was previously implemented across major UI components.
- **Styling Updates (Previous)**: Background, text, border, and interactive element colors were intended to align with the theme using Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Layout Adjustments (Previous)**: Responsive design with a grid layout for KPI cards was implemented.

## Next Steps

- **Await User Feedback**: Await user feedback on the updated filters and general dashboard functionality.
- **Defer Tailwind CSS Troubleshooting**: The persistent Tailwind CSS styling issue (custom colors not applying, transparent dropdowns) will be addressed in a separate, dedicated task if requested.
- **Additional Components**: If new components are added or existing ones modified, ensure they adhere to the theme guidelines in `styleGuide.md`.
- **Testing**: Verify that the theme toggle works seamlessly across all components and that accessibility standards (WCAG AA) are maintained in both light and dark modes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Theme Toggle Placement**: The theme toggle button is currently placed in the header of `DashboardPage.jsx`. Consider if a more persistent placement (e.g., in a settings menu) would be better for user access.
- **Red Accent Usage**: Red is used sparingly for interactive elements to avoid visual overload. Monitor user feedback to ensure it effectively draws attention without being distracting.
- **Performance**: Ensure that theme switching does not impact application performance, especially with larger datasets in `DataTable`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Theme-Aware Styling**: Always use `dark:` classes alongside light theme classes to support both modes (e.g., `bg-neutral-background-light dark:bg-neutral-background-dark`).
- **Accessibility Focus**: Maintain high contrast ratios and visible focus indicators using red accents for all interactive elements.
- **Consistency**: Follow the color palette and spacing system defined in `styleGuide.md` for any new or updated components.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **Tailwind CSS Flexibility**: Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed for rapid implementation of theme-aware styling with minimal custom CSS.
- **Zustand for State Management**: Using Zustand to manage theme state proved effective for sharing the theme preference across components without complex prop drilling.
- **User Experience**: The grid layout for KPI cards improves readability and visual hierarchy, especially on larger screens, aligning with modern dashboard design practices.
