# Active Context for Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Work Focus

**RECENTLY COMPLETED**: Major DataTable usability enhancements successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **DataTable Usability Improvements**:

   - **Horizontal Scrolling**: Added dual horizontal scrollbars (top and bottom) for intuitive navigation
   - **Fixed Sorting Functionality**: Enhanced sorting with proper type detection for numbers, dates, strings, and null values
   - **Column Visibility Controls**: Implemented show/hide column functionality with persistent settings
   - **Enhanced UI**: Improved visual indicators, proper column widths, and accessibility features

2. ✅ **Comprehensive Segment Styling**: Updated segment color coding to handle all 15 RFM segments with logical color hierarchy
3. ✅ **Previous Enhancements**: Sticky headers, drag-and-drop column reordering, recency formatting, and trend sparklines

## Recent Analysis

- **Current Data Table**: The existing `DataTable.jsx` component has sorting functionality but lacks column reordering capabilities
- **Recency Calculation**: In the backend (`rfm_service.py`), recency is calculated as `(x.max() - reference_date).days` which results in negative values (days since last purchase from reference date)
- **User Experience Issue**: Raw negative recency values (-797) are not user-friendly and require interpretation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Column Arrangement Feature

- Add drag-and-drop functionality to table headers
- Implement column reordering state management
- Store user preferences for column order
- Add visual indicators during drag operations

### 2. Recency Display Enhancement

- **Backend**: Add a formatted recency field that converts negative days to positive "days since last purchase"
- **Frontend**: Display recency in user-friendly format (e.g., "797 days ago", "2.2 years ago")
- **Additional Context**: Add tooltips or secondary text to explain recency scoring

## Technical Approach

### Column Reordering

- Use React DnD (react-beautiful-dnd) or HTML5 drag-and-drop
- Add reorder controls to table headers
- Persist column order in local storage or user preferences

### Recency Enhancement

- Modify backend to provide both raw and formatted recency
- Add recency categories (Recent, Moderate, Distant)
- Include visual indicators (colors, icons) for quick interpretation

- **Improved UX**: Click-outside-to-close for dropdowns, proper focus management
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with proper React patterns

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on the enhanced DataTable usability
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor table performance with large datasets
3. **Additional Features**: Consider implementing:
   - Column width resizing
   - Advanced filtering within columns
   - Export functionality for filtered/visible data only
   - Saved view presets

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Design Philosophy**: Prioritizing user control and discoverability in the DataTable interface
- **Color System**: Using logical color progression from green (best) to red (worst risk) for immediate visual understanding
- **Performance vs Features**: Balancing rich functionality with responsive performance
- **Accessibility First**: Ensuring all new features maintain WCAG AA compliance

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **User Control**: Providing granular control over data presentation (column visibility, ordering, sorting)
- **Persistent Settings**: Saving user preferences to enhance workflow efficiency
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Using color, typography, and spacing to guide user attention
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Building features that work well for both novice and power users

## Key Learnings & Patterns

### DataTable Development

- **Dual Scrollbars**: Top scrollbar significantly improves UX for wide tables by eliminating need to scroll down first
- **Robust Sorting**: Proper type detection prevents common sorting issues with mixed data types
- **Column Management**: Users appreciate fine-grained control over data presentation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for sort state and column visibility improve usability

### State Management

- **LocalStorage Integration**: Persisting UI preferences enhances user workflow continuity
- **Component State Isolation**: Keeping feature-specific state (like dropdown visibility) local to components
- **Event Handling**: Proper event propagation handling prevents conflicts between drag/drop and click operations

### Accessibility & UX

- **Color + Text**: Always supplementing color coding with text/icons for accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus states and logical tab order
- **Responsive Design**: Adapting complex interfaces for various screen sizes

## Technical Context

- **DnD Kit**: Successfully integrated for column reordering with sorting functionality
- **Tailwind CSS**: Leveraging utility classes for rapid, consistent styling
- **React Patterns**: Using proper useEffect cleanup and event handling patterns
- **LocalStorage**: Reliable persistence for user preferences across sessions

## Recent Changes

- **Data Connection Resolution**: Successfully re-established the data connection by ensuring the backend server was running and accessible.
- **Filter Modifications**:
  - Updated the backend API (`endpoints.py`) to provide filter options for Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment.
  - Modified the frontend state management (`rfmStore.js`) to handle the new filter set.
  - Updated the UI (`DashboardPage.jsx`) to display the new filters and adjust the filtering logic.
- **Tailwind Configuration Attempts (Previous)**:
  - Uninstalled `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
  - Installed `@tailwindcss/vite`.
  - Updated `vite.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/vite`.
  - Modified `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";`.
  - Adjusted `postcss.config.js` multiple times (commented out, set to minimal).
- **Theme Implementation (Previous)**: Support for light and dark themes was previously implemented across major UI components.
- **Styling Updates (Previous)**: Background, text, border, and interactive element colors were intended to align with the theme using Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Layout Adjustments (Previous)**: Responsive design with a grid layout for KPI cards was implemented.

## Next Steps

- **Await User Feedback**: Await user feedback on the updated filters and general dashboard functionality.
- **Defer Tailwind CSS Troubleshooting**: The persistent Tailwind CSS styling issue (custom colors not applying, transparent dropdowns) will be addressed in a separate, dedicated task if requested.
- **Additional Components**: If new components are added or existing ones modified, ensure they adhere to the theme guidelines in `styleGuide.md`.
- **Testing**: Verify that the theme toggle works seamlessly across all components and that accessibility standards (WCAG AA) are maintained in both light and dark modes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Theme Toggle Placement**: The theme toggle button is currently placed in the header of `DashboardPage.jsx`. Consider if a more persistent placement (e.g., in a settings menu) would be better for user access.
- **Red Accent Usage**: Red is used sparingly for interactive elements to avoid visual overload. Monitor user feedback to ensure it effectively draws attention without being distracting.
- **Performance**: Ensure that theme switching does not impact application performance, especially with larger datasets in `DataTable`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Theme-Aware Styling**: Always use `dark:` classes alongside light theme classes to support both modes (e.g., `bg-neutral-background-light dark:bg-neutral-background-dark`).
- **Accessibility Focus**: Maintain high contrast ratios and visible focus indicators using red accents for all interactive elements.
- **Consistency**: Follow the color palette and spacing system defined in `styleGuide.md` for any new or updated components.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **Tailwind CSS Flexibility**: Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed for rapid implementation of theme-aware styling with minimal custom CSS.
- **Zustand for State Management**: Using Zustand to manage theme state proved effective for sharing the theme preference across components without complex prop drilling.
- **User Experience**: The grid layout for KPI cards improves readability and visual hierarchy, especially on larger screens, aligning with modern dashboard design practices.
