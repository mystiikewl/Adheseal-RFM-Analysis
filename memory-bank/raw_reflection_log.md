TaskRef: "Update CORS Configuration and Create Startup Script for RFM Analysis Dashboard"

Learnings:

- Configuring CORS to allow requests from any origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`) in FastAPI is a straightforward way to enable network access for frontend-backend communication, especially during development.
- Creating a batch file (`start_project.bat`) on Windows to launch multiple servers simultaneously using the `start` command improves development efficiency by automating the startup process.
- Updating memory bank files as per user request requires a thorough review of all core files to ensure accurate documentation of project state, recent changes, and next steps.

Difficulties:

- Ensuring the CORS configuration change did not introduce security risks required a note in the documentation to revisit this setting for production environments.
- Crafting a batch script that works across different Windows environments necessitated careful consideration of command syntax and terminal behavior to ensure reliability.

Successes:

- The CORS update successfully resolved connectivity issues, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend from any network location during development.
- The `start_project.bat` script effectively launches both the backend and frontend servers in separate terminal windows, streamlining the development workflow.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: CORS configuration strategy for development vs. production environments.
- Project-specific: Commands for running both servers simultaneously using a batch script on Windows.
- Documentation practice: Importance of updating memory bank files to maintain project continuity across sessions.
