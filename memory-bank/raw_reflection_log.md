TaskRef: "Diagnose and fix Tailwind CSS styling issue on RFM Dashboard - Part 2 (Vite Plugin)"

Learnings:
  - The error message "[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin..." indicates that the direct PostCSS plugin method is outdated for the current setup.
  - For Vite projects, using the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin is the recommended approach for Tailwind CSS integration.
  - This involves:
      1. Uninstalling potentially conflicting packages like `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
      2. Installing `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`.
      3. Adding `@tailwindcss/vite` to the `plugins` array in `vite.config.js`.
      4. Changing the main CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`) to use `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of the traditional `@tailwind base/components/utilities;` directives.
      5. The `postcss.config.js` may become redundant or only needed for other PostCSS plugins like `autoprefixer` if not handled by the Vite plugin.

Difficulties:
  - Initial attempt to fix `postcss.config.js` was based on a common but not universally applicable PostCSS setup, leading to the error. The error message itself provided the correct path forward.

Successes:
  - Successfully transitioned the project to use the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin.
  - Followed the official Tailwind CSS documentation for Vite integration.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - Update the "Tailwind CSS Troubleshooting Checklist" in `consolidated_learnings.md` to include checking for Vite-specific integration (`@tailwindcss/vite`) if the project uses Vite.
  - Emphasize reading and trusting specific error messages from build tools, as they often guide directly to the solution.
