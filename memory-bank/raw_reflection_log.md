TaskRef: "Add export button to dashboard filter section, remove from data table"

Learnings:
- User clarified that the request to add an export button to the filter section also implied removing the existing export button from the DataTable component. This highlights the importance of clarifying whether new UI elements are additive or replacements if the initial request is ambiguous.
- Successfully identified high context window usage (53%) and offered to create a new task as per `new-task-automation.md` protocol.

Difficulties:
- Initial plan assumed the new button would be an addition. User feedback corrected this.

Successes:
- Successfully relocated the export functionality to the desired location (filter bar).
- Adapted to user's refined requirement (remove old button).
- Followed styling guidelines for the new button.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When adding UI elements that have existing counterparts, explicitly clarify with the user if the new element is an addition or a replacement/move.
- `cline-for-webdev-ui.md` could be updated to prompt this clarification.
- `new-task-automation.md` could suggest re-confirming new task creation if significant new instructions are given after the initial offer but before acceptance/rejection.
