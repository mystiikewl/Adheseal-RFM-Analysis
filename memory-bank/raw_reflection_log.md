TaskRef: "Creation of Data Preprocessing Strategy for RFM Analysis"

Learnings:

- Understood the importance of a structured preprocessing strategy to address data quality issues like negative transaction values, missing data, and invalid postcodes, ensuring accurate RFM analysis.
- Recognized that simple exclusion rules and logging can effectively handle data issues without overcomplicating the initial backend setup.
- Learned to balance immediate data needs with future scalability by documenting considerations for caching, database migration, and alternative data processing libraries like Polars.
- Confirmed the value of integrating preprocessing logic early in the backend pipeline to prevent downstream errors in RFM calculations.

Difficulties:

- Faced the challenge of prioritizing which data quality issues to address immediately versus deferring to future enhancements, given the user's emphasis on avoiding overcomplication.
- Resolved by focusing on critical issues affecting RFM metrics (e.g., negative `amount` values) while logging non-critical issues (e.g., missing `branch` data) for later review, aligning with a minimal viable approach.

Successes:

- Successfully created `data_preprocessing_strategy.md`, a comprehensive document that outlines actionable steps for data cleaning, integrity checks, and performance optimization.
- Ensured the strategy aligns with project goals by incorporating insights from `data_quality_report.md` and adhering to guidelines in `rfmAnalysisGuidelines.md`.
- Achieved a balance between simplicity and foresight by including future considerations without mandating immediate complex implementations, meeting the user's requirement to avoid overcomplication.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Develop a preprocessing strategy early in data-driven projects to address quality issues systematically, ensuring reliable analytical outcomes like RFM scores.
- General pattern: Use logging extensively during data preprocessing to maintain transparency and support debugging, especially for excluded or flagged data.
- Project-specific: Prioritize data issues impacting core metrics (e.g., negative values for Monetary in RFM) over secondary fields to keep initial implementation focused and effective.
- Project-specific: Structure preprocessing logic in backend services (e.g., `rfm_service.py`) to ensure cleaned data is used consistently across all API endpoints.

TaskRef: "Data Analysis and Documentation for RFM Analysis Preparation"

Learnings:

- Discovered the structure and content of `customer_data.csv` (1,863 rows, 12 columns) and `sales_data.csv` (67,800 rows, 11 columns), providing a clear understanding of the data available for RFM analysis.
- Identified key identifiers like `customer_code` for linking datasets, and critical metrics such as `date`, `amount`, and `transaction_number` for RFM calculations.
- Learned about data quality issues, including missing values in `branch` (25) and `delivery_suburb` (11) in `sales_data.csv`, negative values in financial metrics indicating refunds, and invalid postcodes (e.g., 0) in both datasets.
- Confirmed the importance of early data analysis to inform backend preprocessing logic before RFM calculation implementation.

Difficulties:

- Encountered an initial error when running `data_analyzer.py` due to a missing `pandas` module in the `adheseal_rfm` environment, despite prior installation attempts.
- Resolved by reinstalling `pandas` using `conda install` within the specific environment, highlighting potential discrepancies in environment setup or package management between `pip` and `conda`.

Successes:

- Successfully created `data_headers.json` to document column headers, ensuring accurate reference for future backend functions.
- Developed and executed `data_analyzer.py`, generating a comprehensive report on dataset structure and key metrics, with a focus on `amount`, `salesperson`, `branch`, and `profit` for sales data.
- Documented data quality insights in `data_quality_report.md`, providing a valuable reference for data preprocessing strategies.
- The resolution of the `pandas` installation issue allowed for seamless execution of the analysis script, demonstrating effective troubleshooting.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Early data analysis and documentation are critical for identifying quality issues before development, preventing skewed results in analytical models like RFM.
- General pattern: When working with Conda environments, use `conda install` for core data science packages like `pandas` to avoid dependency conflicts, rather than mixing with `pip`.
- Project-specific: Establish a data preprocessing checklist based on `data_quality_report.md` to handle negative values, missing data, and invalid entries before RFM calculations.
- Project-specific: Maintain a reference file like `data_headers.json` for all datasets to ensure consistency in column naming across backend and frontend development.
