# Product Context: Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Purpose

The Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide a powerful tool for customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. This project exists to help businesses understand customer behavior, identify key customer segments, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Problems Solved

- **Customer Segmentation**: The dashboard addresses the challenge of identifying valuable customer groups by analyzing their purchasing patterns. It helps in distinguishing between high-value, loyal customers and those at risk of churn.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: By providing clear metrics and visualizations, the tool enables businesses to make informed decisions rather than relying on intuition or incomplete data.
- **Marketing Efficiency**: With insights into customer behavior, marketing efforts can be targeted more effectively, reducing waste and increasing return on investment.
- **Scalability Issues**: The decoupled architecture ensures that the system can handle growing datasets and evolving business needs without significant rework.

## How It Should Work

- **Data Processing**: The backend will load raw sales and customer data, perform RFM calculations, and make this data available through a REST API. This ensures that the heavy computational work is done server-side, keeping the frontend lightweight.
- **Interactive Interface**: The frontend will fetch RFM data from the API and present it in an interactive dashboard. Users should be able to apply filters, view key performance indicators (KPIs), and potentially explore advanced visualizations like scatter plots.
- **Seamless Integration**: The system should integrate smoothly with existing data sources (initially CSV files, with potential future migration to databases) and provide a consistent user experience regardless of data volume or complexity.

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitiveness**: The dashboard should be easy to navigate, with clear labels, logical layout of information, and minimal learning curve for new users.
- **Interactivity**: Users should be able to interact with the data through filters and other controls to drill down into specific customer segments or time periods.
- **Performance**: The system should provide quick responses to user interactions, with loading states and error messages to handle delays or issues gracefully.
- **Actionable Insights**: The visualizations and data presented should directly support business decisions, highlighting trends and segments that require attention.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the interface adheres to accessibility standards, making it usable for all team members, including those with disabilities.
