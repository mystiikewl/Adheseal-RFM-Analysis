# Progress for Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Status

The front-end redesign of the Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard was intended to implement a modern and clean styling with support for both light and dark themes. However, there are ongoing issues with Tailwind CSS configuration, preventing custom theme colors and some styles from being applied correctly (e.g., transparent dropdown backgrounds, unstyled buttons).

## What Works

- **Basic Layout & Structure**: The overall page structure, component placement (KPI cards, filters, data table), and responsive grid for KPI cards appear to be functioning.
- **Theme Toggle Logic**: The Zustand store and toggle functionality for switching between light and dark modes are likely in place, but the visual effect is incomplete due to styling issues.
- **Data Display (Unstyled)**: Data is being fetched and displayed in components, though without the intended custom styling.

## What's Left to Build

- **Resolve Tailwind CSS Styling**: The primary outstanding task is to correctly configure Tailwind CSS (v4 with Vite) so that custom theme colors and all intended styles are applied. This is deferred to a future task.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Once styling is resolved, await user feedback to refine or adjust the theme, color usage, or component layout if necessary.
- **Additional Testing**: After styling is fixed, conduct thorough testing to ensure the theme toggle performs well and all elements are styled correctly across different devices and browsers.
- **Potential Enhancements**: Consider adding a persistent settings menu for theme selection or other user preferences if requested by the user.

## Known Issues

- **Tailwind CSS Styling Not Applying**: Custom theme colors (e.g., for backgrounds, text, buttons) and some component-specific styles (e.g., dropdown backgrounds) are not rendering. Elements appear unstyled or with default browser styles. This is the main blocker for the UI.
- **"Export CSV" Button Unstyled**: Despite having Tailwind classes in the JSX, the button does not reflect the intended primary button style.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Request**: The user requested a redesign of the front-end and components, specifically mentioning the layout of KPI components and proposing a modern, clean theme with dark/light modes and red accents.
- **Design Approach**: Adopted a theme-aware styling system using Tailwind CSS with a custom color palette in `tailwind.config.js` to support light/dark modes and red accents for interactivity.
- **Implementation**: Updated all major components with theme-aware classes, added a theme toggle in the dashboard header, and ensured responsive design for better usability.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensured Memory Bank files are current to maintain project knowledge and guide future development or refinements.
