# Progress: Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Status

The Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard project has progressed beyond the initialization phase to **data preparation and quality assessment**. The focus has been on setting up the Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation and conducting initial data analysis to ensure dataset suitability for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. No actual development work on the backend or frontend application logic has started yet.

## What Works

- **Memory Bank Setup**: The core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and this `progress.md`) have been created and updated. These files capture the project's goals, architecture, technologies, and current focus.
- **Data Analysis and Documentation**:
  - Documented column headers in `data_headers.json` for accurate reference in backend functions.
  - Created and executed `data_analyzer.py` to generate a detailed report on dataset structure, completeness, and key metrics for `customer_data.csv` and `sales_data.csv`.
  - Added `data_quality_report.md` to the Memory Bank, summarizing data quality insights, identifying key identifiers like `customer_code`, and noting preprocessing considerations such as negative transaction values and invalid postcodes.
- No functional components or features of the dashboard have been implemented at this stage.

## What's Left to Build

- **Backend Development**:

  - Set up the `rfm_backend` directory structure as outlined in the project briefing, including `app/` subdirectories for API, services, models, and data.
  - Implement data loading and RFM calculation logic in `rfm_service.py` using Pandas, adhering to best practices for performance and incorporating data preprocessing strategies based on `data_quality_report.md`.
  - Define API endpoints in `endpoints.py` with Pydantic models for data validation.
  - Configure CORS and other middleware in `main.py` to support frontend integration.
  - Establish testing framework in `tests/` directory for unit and integration tests.

- **Frontend Development**:

  - Set up the `rfm_frontend` directory structure with `src/` for components, pages, services, and state management.
  - Develop reusable UI components like `KpiCard.jsx` and `FilterDropdown.jsx` for dashboard elements.
  - Implement API communication layer in `api.js` for centralized data fetching.
  - Create the main dashboard view in `DashboardPage.jsx` with interactive features like filters.
  - Configure state management using Zustand or Context API for shared data across components.
  - Style the interface using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and consistent design.

- **API Contract and Integration**:

  - Finalize the API contract between backend and frontend to ensure seamless data flow, incorporating validated data structures from the analysis.
  - Test integration between frontend API calls and backend endpoints for data retrieval.

- **Future Enhancements** (as outlined in project briefing):
  - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for RFM calculation results to improve performance.
  - Add asynchronous data refresh mechanisms (e.g., Celery) for periodic updates.
  - Migrate from CSV files to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for better scalability.
  - Enhance frontend with advanced visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) and data export features.
  - Containerize the application using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Known Issues

- **No Development Progress**: As the project is in the data preparation phase, there are no implemented features or code to report issues on.
- **Data Quality Concerns**: Analysis has identified issues with data integrity in the CSV files, such as missing values in `branch` and `delivery_suburb`, negative values in financial metrics (`cost`, `amount`, `profit`), and invalid postcodes (e.g., 0). These will need to be addressed with validation and cleaning steps in the backend once development starts, as detailed in `data_quality_report.md`.
- **Performance at Scale**: Anticipated challenges with large datasets (e.g., 67,800 sales records) using Pandas, which will require optimization or architectural changes (e.g., Polars, pre-calculation) as data grows.
- **API Security**: Lack of authentication currently poses a risk for data exposure, to be mitigated with API keys or OAuth2 in future development phases.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initialization Focus**: The decision to prioritize Memory Bank setup ensures that all project context, goals, and technical decisions are documented from the start, facilitating continuity across sessions and team members.
- **Data Preparation Emphasis**: Recent focus on data analysis and quality documentation reflects a strategic decision to address data integrity early, ensuring RFM calculations are based on accurate datasets and reducing the risk of rework in later development stages.
- **Decoupled Architecture Commitment**: The project adheres to a strict separation of backend and frontend responsibilities, a decision made to enhance modularity and scalability from the outset.
- No significant changes or pivots in project direction have occurred yet, as application development has not begun.
