# Progress for Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Status

The Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard is functional with a modern and clean styling, supporting both light and dark themes. Recent work focused on integrating and optimizing data processing for the RFM visualization components, ensuring styling and accessibility, and updating the available filters to Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment.

## What Works

- **Basic Layout & Structure**: The overall page structure, component placement (KPI cards, filters, data table), and responsive grid for KPI cards are functioning.
- **Theme Toggle Logic**: The Zustand store and toggle functionality for switching between light and dark modes are in place.
- **Data Display and Filtering**: Data is being fetched, displayed, and can be filtered using the updated filter set (Customer Type, Salesperson, Segment).
- **Data Connection**: The data connection between the frontend and backend is stable.
- **RFM Visualizations Integration**: Segment Bar Chart, Segment Treemap, Monetary Bar Chart, and RFM Heatmap are integrated into the dashboard layout in a 2x2 grid.
- **Visualization Data Optimization**: Data processing for all visualization components is optimized using `useMemo` in `DashboardPage.jsx` to improve performance.
- **Styling and Accessibility**: Visualization components adhere to styling guidelines and include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for WCAG AA compliance.

## What's Left to Build

- **User Feedback Integration**: Await user feedback on the updated dashboard functionality, visualizations, and overall user experience.
- **Additional Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all elements function and are styled correctly across different devices and browsers.
- **Potential Enhancements**: Consider adding a persistent settings menu for theme selection or other user preferences if requested by the user.

## Known Issues

- None currently.


## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Request**: The user requested a redesign of the front-end and components, specifically mentioning the layout of KPI components and proposing a modern, clean theme with dark/light modes and red accents.
- **Design Approach**: Adopted a theme-aware styling system using Tailwind CSS with a custom color palette in `tailwind.config.js` to support light/dark modes and red accents for interactivity.
- **Implementation**: Updated all major components with theme-aware classes, added a theme toggle in the dashboard header, and ensured responsive design for better usability.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensured Memory Bank files are current to maintain project knowledge and guide future development or refinements.
