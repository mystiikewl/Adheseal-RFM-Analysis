  - **Column Management**: Show/hide columns with persistent preferences
  - **Drag & Drop**: Column reordering with localStorage persistence
  - **Enhanced Visuals**: Proper column widths, sticky headers, hover states
- **Comprehensive Segment Styling**: All 15 RFM segments with logical color hierarchy:
  - Green gradient for highest value customers
  - Yellow/Orange for attention needed
  - Red for high risk/lost customers
  - Blue for price-focused segments
  - Gray for uncategorized

### Dashboard Features

- **KPI Cards**: Real-time metrics display with responsive grid layout
- **Filtering System**: Advanced filtering by Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment
- **Visualization Suite**: Integrated RFM charts (Bar Charts, Treemap, Heatmap) with optimized performance
- **Search Functionality**: Global search across all customer data
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Priorities

- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and integrate user feedback on the enhanced DataTable functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Stress test with larger datasets to ensure scalability
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify functionality across different browsers and devices

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Advanced Table Features**:
  - Column width resizing
  - In-cell editing capabilities
  - Advanced filtering within columns
  - Saved view presets
- **Export Enhancements**:
  - Export filtered/visible data only
  - Multiple export formats (Excel, PDF)
- **Data Refresh**: Real-time or scheduled data updates
- **Database Migration**: Move from CSV to PostgreSQL for better scalability

## Known Issues

- **None Currently**: All major usability issues have been resolved
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continue monitoring table performance with large datasets
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ongoing testing for edge cases across different browsers
