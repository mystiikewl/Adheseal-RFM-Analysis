# Progress for Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Current Status

The Adheseal RFM Analysis Dashboard is functional with a modern and clean styling, supporting both light and dark themes. Recent work focused on resolving a data connection issue and updating the available filters to Customer Type, Salesperson, and Segment. Ongoing issues with Tailwind CSS configuration (custom theme colors not applying) are deferred.

## What Works

- **Basic Layout & Structure**: The overall page structure, component placement (KPI cards, filters, data table), and responsive grid for KPI cards are functioning.
- **Theme Toggle Logic**: The Zustand store and toggle functionality for switching between light and dark modes are in place.
- **Data Display and Filtering**: Data is being fetched, displayed, and can be filtered using the updated filter set (Customer Type, Salesperson, Segment).
- **Data Connection**: The data connection between the frontend and backend is stable.

## What's Left to Build

- **Resolve Tailwind CSS Styling (Deferred)**: The primary outstanding task is to correctly configure Tailwind CSS (v4 with Vite) so that custom theme colors and all intended styles are applied. This is deferred to a future task if requested.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Await user feedback on the updated filters and general dashboard functionality. If styling is addressed, await feedback on theme, color usage, or component layout.
- **Additional Testing**: After any further changes, conduct thorough testing to ensure all elements function and are styled correctly across different devices and browsers.
- **Potential Enhancements**: Consider adding a persistent settings menu for theme selection or other user preferences if requested by the user.

## Known Issues

- **Tailwind CSS Styling Not Applying (Deferred)**: Custom theme colors (e.g., for backgrounds, text, buttons) and some component-specific styles (e.g., dropdown backgrounds) are not rendering. Elements appear unstyled or with default browser styles. This is a known UI issue, deferred for now.
- **"Export CSV" Button Unstyled (Deferred)**: Despite having Tailwind classes in the JSX, the button does not reflect the intended primary button style. This is related to the general Tailwind CSS styling issue.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Request**: The user requested a redesign of the front-end and components, specifically mentioning the layout of KPI components and proposing a modern, clean theme with dark/light modes and red accents.
- **Design Approach**: Adopted a theme-aware styling system using Tailwind CSS with a custom color palette in `tailwind.config.js` to support light/dark modes and red accents for interactivity.
- **Implementation**: Updated all major components with theme-aware classes, added a theme toggle in the dashboard header, and ensured responsive design for better usability.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensured Memory Bank files are current to maintain project knowledge and guide future development or refinements.
